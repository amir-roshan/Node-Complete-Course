MVC is for separation of concerns and design patterns.
Model - Data, View - User Interface, Controller - Business Logic

Model is object that represents the data in your application. 
It is responsible for managing the data of the application. 
It responds to the request from the view and to the instructions from the controller to update itself.

View is the user interface of the application. 
Decoupled from the model and controller.

Controllers are responsible for responding to user input and perform interactions on the data model objects.
Relates the model and view.
